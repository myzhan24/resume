                 \section{PROJECTS}
                         \textbf {ReQ} \\                 
                         Description: Lead a team to develop a two-interface mobile application to enhance the dining experience. The idea behind the system is to save time through a specialized communication platform between diners and the restaurant. The diners' phone app connects to their current restaurant's tablet app. The waiter's tablet interface shows a top-down layout of the tables and displays real-time notifications of common diner needs. From the phone app, diners can request an order, their check, refills, new silverware, or a custom message without having to call over a waiter. Additionally, diners can request a table from the app and skip the physical line.

                         \textbf{Rho} \\
                         Description: Developed a 2D platform shooter game built on a custom physics engine. The deep mechanics of the game allow for practically infinite variations of situations from features including gravity, grappling hooks, and over 10 unique physics-based weapons.

                         \textbf{Kepler Orbit} \\
                         Description: Developed a 2D universe simulator physics sandbox that exhibits the effect of gravity between bodies of mass. Progammed additional features for artistic expression, including path tracing and strobe lights. Developed it for both Android and iOS and released it on the AppStore. \\
