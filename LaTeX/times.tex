                         \textbf {ReQ} \\                 
                         Description: Lead a team to develop a two-interface mobile application to enhance the dining experience. The idea behind the system is to provide a communication channel between diners and the restaurant. The diners have an app on their phone and can connect to their current restaurant's tablet app. The waiter's interface shows a top-down layout of the tables and displays real-time notifications of common diner needs. From the phone app, diners can instantly order from the menu, get the check, ask for refills, and more without having to call over a waiter, saving valuable time for diners and the restaurant.

                         \textbf{Rho} \\
                         Description: Developed a 2D platform shooter game built on a realistic physics engine. Practically infinite variations of situations with gravity, grappling hooks, and over 10 unique physics-based weapons.

                         \textbf{Kepler Orbit} \\
                         Description: Developed a 2D physics sandbox that simulates the effect of gravity between bodies of mass. Progammed additional features for artistic expression, including line tracing and glowing. Released the app for iOS on the App Store. \\
